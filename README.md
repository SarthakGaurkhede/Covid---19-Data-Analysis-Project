🦠 COVID-19 Data Analysis Project
📌 Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of COVID-19 using Python. It aims to uncover insights into the global and country-level spread of the virus, its impact over time, and comparative trends using various visualizations and statistical techniques.

🧰 Tools & Technologies Used
Python

Pandas for data manipulation

NumPy for numerical operations

Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization

Jupyter Notebook for interactive development

COVID-19 dataset (likely sourced from Our World in Data or similar)

🔍 Key Analysis Performed
Overview of total cases, deaths, recoveries

Country-wise comparison and sorting of COVID-19 statistics

Time series analysis to examine the trend of cases over time

Visualizations such as line plots, bar charts, and scatter plots

Analysis of death rates, recovery rates, and testing statistics

📈 Visual Insights
The notebook includes various visualizations that make it easy to interpret the progression and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic in different countries and over time. Charts show:

Daily and cumulative case counts

Death vs. recovery rates

Country-wise active and critical cases

Total vaccinations and testing coverage
